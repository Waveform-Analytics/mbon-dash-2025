## 🎯 Scientific Insights

### 1. **Temporal Context is Critical**
- Adding temporal features improved performance by 5.1%
- Historical biological activity is the strongest predictor
- Rolling statistics capture important trend information
- Recent activity patterns (4-24h) are most informative

### 2. **Acoustic vs Environmental Equivalence**  
- Both approaches achieve comparable peak performance
- Acoustic features: More individually predictive (higher mutual information)
- Environmental features: Better mean performance across all features
- **Recommendation**: Use both approaches complementarily rather than exclusively

### 3. **Biological Feedback Loops**
- Recent biological activity is the strongest predictor of current activity
- Suggests strong temporal autocorrelation in marine ecosystems
- Short-term memory effects (4-24 hours) most important
- Activity increasing/decreasing trends add predictive value

### 4. **Seasonality Effects**
- Monthly patterns significantly improve predictions  
- Seasonal biological rhythms are detectable and predictive
- Cyclical encoding more effective than categorical representations

### 5. **Feature Engineering Impact**
- Raw acoustic indices alone achieve F1 = 0.845
- Temporal engineering boosts performance to F1 = 0.890
- Rolling statistics more valuable than simple lag features
- Trend analysis captures important dynamics
