## Executive Summary

**Phase 9 successfully developed a season-aware priority ranking system to guide manual detection efforts for marine species.** Using 2D probability surfaces built from kernel density estimation, the system identifies high-priority time periods for manual review during biologically active seasons.

### Key Results

- **Silver perch**: 86.6% detection efficiency with only 20% manual effort 
- **Oyster toadfish boat whistle**: AUC = 0.944, 69.2% detection efficiency
- **Spotted seatrout**: Strong cross-station generalization (AUC = 0.887)
- **Cross-station validation**: Models trained on 2 stations generalize well to the third

### Business Impact

**This system can reduce manual detection workload by 80% while maintaining high detection sensitivity**, making large-scale acoustic monitoring practically feasible.

## Background and Motivation

### The Challenge

Manual detection of marine species vocalizations in acoustic datasets is:
- **Time-intensive**: Thousands of hours of recordings
- **Expensive**: Requires expert knowledge
- **Inconsistent**: Varies between analysts

### Previous Approaches (Phase 8 Lessons)

Our initial attempt at temporal-aware ML models failed because it tried to predict **across seasons** (summer patterns → winter silence). Key insight: **Don't fight seasonality, leverage it.**

### The Solution: Manual Detection Guidance

**Instead of full automation, provide intelligent guidance:**
- Focus manual effort during appropriate seasons
- Rank time periods by likelihood of species activity
- Use biological context as a feature, not an obstacle

---

## Technical Approach

### 2D Probability Surface Framework

We model species detection probability as a function of temporal coordinates:

```
P(detection) = f(day_of_year, time_of_day)
```

**Key Innovation**: Combined seasonal and daily patterns in a single 2D surface using kernel density estimation.

### Method Overview

1. **Baseline Surface Construction**
   - Extract detection events: (day_of_year, period_of_day) coordinates
   - Apply kernel density estimation with Gaussian kernels
   - Normalize to probability surface (365 days × 12 periods)

2. **Acoustic & Environmental Enhancement**
   - Add acoustic indices from Phase 6/7 correlations
   - Include environmental features (temperature, sound levels)
   - Local enhancement factors based on feature patterns

3. **Cross-Station Validation**
   - Train on 2 stations, test on the third
   - 3-fold validation across all station combinations
   - Measure detection efficiency and time savings

### Data Specifications

- **Dataset**: 2021 acoustic monitoring data (13,100 records)
- **Temporal Resolution**: 2-hour periods (12 per day)
- **Stations**: 9M, 14M, 37M (cross-validation folds)
- **Features**: 10 acoustic indices + 4 environmental variables

*Left: Detection efficiency when checking top 20% and 30% of ranked periods. Right: AUC scores across species.*

### Generalization Performance

**Strong Evidence for Cross-Site Generalization:**
- Silver perch: Consistent 79-92% efficiency across all stations

## Practical Implementation

### Workflow Integration

**For Research Teams:**
1. **Upload new acoustic data** to system
2. **Generate priority rankings** for target species/season
3. **Focus manual detection** on top 20-30% of periods
4. **Achieve 60-85% detection efficiency** with major time savings

### Example Use Case: Spring 2024 Survey

**Scenario**: 3 months of new acoustic data, focus on oyster toadfish spawning

**Traditional Approach**: 
- Review all 3,240 periods (3 months × 30 days × 12 periods)
- Estimated time: 270 hours at 5 minutes per period

**Guided Approach**:
- Review top 20% ranked periods (648 periods)
- Estimated time: 54 hours
- **Expected detection rate: 69% of total toadfish activity**
- **Time savings: 216 hours (80% reduction)**

### Quality Control Recommendations

1. **Validate on known patterns**: Check system ranking against previous year's data
2. **Adaptive thresholds**: Adjust percentage checked based on research priorities
3. **Multi-species mode**: Combined rankings when targeting multiple species
4. **Uncertainty flagging**: Mark periods with low confidence scores

## Comparison with Previous Approaches

| Approach | Phase 8 (Temporal ML) | Phase 9 (Detection Guidance) |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Objective** | Predict species presence | Guide manual detection efforts |
| **Temporal Strategy** | Cross-seasonal prediction | Within-season prioritization |
| **Validation** | Chronological train/test | Cross-station validation |
| **Best Result** | Vessels: +14% F1 | Silver perch: 86.6% efficiency |
| **Fish Species** | Failed (-93% to -100%) | Strong performance (67-87%) |
| **Biological Realism** | Fought seasonality | Leveraged seasonality |

### Why Phase 9 Succeeded Where Phase 8 Failed

1. **Right Question**: "Where to look?" vs "What will happen?"
2. **Biological Context**: Used seasonal patterns as features
3. **Validation Strategy**: Spatial (cross-station) vs temporal splits
4. **Practical Value**: Efficiency gains vs prediction accuracy

1. **Single-year training**: Only 2021 data available
2. **Station similarity**: All sites in similar acoustic environment
3. **Species imbalance**: Some species have limited detections
4. **Manual validation needed**: System provides guidance, not decisions

### Future Enhancements

**Near-term (Phase 10)**:
- Multi-year validation when additional data available
- Species-specific threshold optimization
- Integration with existing analysis workflows

**Medium-term**:
- Real-time implementation for cable-connected systems

- Multi-site deployment across different habitat types

**Long-term**:
- Literature-based probability surfaces for new locations
- AI-assisted partial automation of high-confidence periods
