# Site Restructuring Plan: Soundscape Biodiversity Dashboard

## Core Research Question
**"Can acoustic indices help us predict soundscape biodiversity and serve as proxies for more complex marine biodiversity monitoring?"**

## Research Narrative
This dashboard explores whether computed acoustic indices can replace or supplement expensive, labor-intensive species detection methods for understanding marine soundscape biodiversity. We focus on identifying which indices are most informative for biodiversity assessment and understanding the environmental factors that might influence these relationships.
