# Dolphin Reintegration Plan
**Re-integrating dolphins into the marine community analysis pipeline**

## Overview
Dolphins were filtered out early in the analysis (around notebooks 2-3), but they should be part of the complete marine biological community. This plan systematically adds them back through the existing pipeline, culminating in comparative modeling (fish-only vs full marine community) in notebook 6.

## Strategy
1. **Work through existing notebooks sequentially** - modify to include dolphins
2. **Keep existing fish-only analysis** - don't break what's working
3. **Add dolphins to create full marine community metrics** 
4. **Comparative modeling in notebook 6** - fish-only vs marine community
5. **Dashboard updates** - only if comparative results are compelling

## Phase 4: Comparative Community Pattern Detection (Notebook 6)
**Goal**: Implement both fish-only and full marine community approaches for comparison

### Step 4.1: Prepare Comparative Framework
- [ ] **Notebook**: `python/scripts/notebooks/06_community_pattern_detection.py`
- [ ] **Actions**:
  - Load enhanced community data (with dolphins)
  - Create two parallel datasets:
    - `fish_only_data`: Original fish-focused metrics
    - `marine_community_data`: Fish + dolphin metrics
  - Ensure identical environmental features for fair comparison
  - Define comparable target variables for both approaches
- [ ] **Test**: Validate both datasets have same structure
- [ ] **Commit**: "Set up comparative analysis framework"

### Step 4.2: Train Fish-Only Models (Baseline)
- [ ] **Notebook**: Continue in `06_community_pattern_detection.py`
- [ ] **Actions**:
  - Train existing fish-only screening models
  - Use original fish community targets
  - Document baseline performance metrics
  - Save fish-only models and results
- [ ] **Test**: Verify fish-only models match previous performance
- [ ] **Commit**: "Train baseline fish-only screening models"

### Step 4.3: Train Marine Community Models
- [ ] **Notebook**: Continue in `06_community_pattern_detection.py`
- [ ] **Actions**:
  - Train equivalent models using full marine community data
  - Use marine community targets (fish + dolphin activity)
  - Apply identical model types and hyperparameters
  - Document marine community model performance
  - Save marine community models and results
- [ ] **Test**: Review marine community model performance
- [ ] **Commit**: "Train marine community screening models"

### Step 4.4: Comparative Analysis
- [ ] **Notebook**: Continue in `06_community_pattern_detection.py`
- [ ] **Actions**:
  - Compare model performance metrics side-by-side
  - Analyze differences in:
    - Precision, Recall, F1-scores
    - Feature importance rankings
    - Temporal pattern detection capability
    - False positive/negative patterns
  - Document key findings and insights
  - Create summary comparison tables
- [ ] **Test**: Review comparative analysis results
- [ ] **Commit**: "Complete comparative model analysis"

## Phase 5: Decision Point & Optional Dashboard Updates
**Goal**: Evaluate results and decide on dashboard integration

### Step 5.1: Evaluate Comparative Results
- [ ] **Actions**:
  - Review model performance differences
  - Assess biological/scientific value of including dolphins
  - Determine if comparative results warrant dashboard updates
  - Document decision rationale
- [ ] **Decision**: Proceed with dashboard updates? (Yes/No)

### Step 5.2: Dashboard Updates (Optional - if results are compelling)
- [ ] **Actions** (if proceeding):
  - Generate dashboard data with comparative results
  - Create visualizations showing both approaches
  - Update dashboard to display comparison
  - Test dashboard functionality
- [ ] **Commit**: "Add comparative marine community dashboard" (if applicable)

## Key Principles

### 1. Incremental & Reversible
- Work through notebooks sequentially
- Commit after each notebook modification
- Each commit provides a rollback point
- Test thoroughly before proceeding

### 2. Preserve Existing Work
- Don't break current fish-only analysis
- Build on existing structure rather than replacing
- Maintain compatibility with current outputs

### 3. Fair Comparison
- Use identical environmental features
- Apply same modeling approaches
- Ensure comparable evaluation metrics
- Document any methodological differences

### 4. Scientific Rigor
- Include dolphins for biological completeness
- Compare approaches objectively
- Document limitations and assumptions
- Let results guide dashboard decisions

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Notebook-by-notebook**: Run and validate each modified notebook
- **Data continuity**: Ensure data flows properly between notebooks
- **Comparative validation**: Check that both approaches are truly comparable
- **Performance baseline**: Maintain fish-only performance as baseline

## Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced biological representation**: Full marine community included
- **Comparative insights**: Understanding of dolphins' contribution to patterns
- **Improved screening**: Potentially better detection of marine biodiversity
- **Dashboard flexibility**: Option to show fish-only or full community
