# Explore Section: Interactive Data Story Plan

## Overview

The "Explore" section presents a narrative-driven, interactive tour through the key findings of the acoustic indices analysis. Using D3.js visualizations inspired by the Python analysis (notebooks 1-4), this section tells the story of how acoustic indices can serve as biological screening tools for marine monitoring.

**Target Audience**: Much of the audience will be scientists - biologists, acousticians, people who work with marine ecosystems and management areas. Not everyone will have the same background so it needs to be explained clearly. but not in a patronizing way. It should be direct and not flowery. 

**Technical Approach**: Interactive D3.js visualizations using processed data from the Python notebooks, served via the existing API infrastructure.
