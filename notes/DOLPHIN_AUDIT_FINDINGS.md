# Phase 1 Audit Findings: Dolphin Exclusion Analysis

## Key Discovery: Dolphins Are Actually Included in Pipeline!

After auditing notebooks 01 and 02, I discovered that **dolphins were NOT filtered out** as we initially thought.

## Evidence:

### 1. Metadata Shows Dolphins Should Be Included
In `data/raw/metadata/det_column_names.csv`:
- **Line 20**: `Bottlenose dolphin echolocation,bde,bio,dolphin,1` ✅ **keep_species=1**
- **Line 21**: `Bottlenose dolphin burst pulses,bdbp,bio,dolphin,1` ✅ **keep_species=1** 
- **Line 22**: `Bottlenose dolphin whistles,bdw,bio,dolphin,1` ✅ **keep_species=1**

### 2. Notebook 01: Data Prep Includes Dolphins
- **Lines 140-141**: Species filtering based on `keep_species=1` includes dolphins
- **Line 171**: Output shows "Kept species: [list includes dolphins]"
- **Lines 1115-1137**: Detection data saved includes all `keep_species=1` columns

### 3. Notebook 02: Temporal Aggregation Processes All Detection Data
- **Lines 528-537**: All detection columns are included in combined dataset
- **Line 534**: Only metadata columns are dropped (`Date`, `Time`, `Deployment ID`, `File`)
- **Species detection columns are preserved and passed through**

## Conclusion: The Problem is NOT Exclusion

The dolphins are actually flowing through the pipeline! The real issues are likely:

1. **Metric incompatibility**: Fish (0-3 scale) vs dolphins (raw counts)
2. **Lack of dolphin-specific analysis**: Treated as just another "species" column
3. **No dolphin intensity conversion**: Raw counts never converted to comparable scale
4. **Missing marine community metrics**: No combined fish+dolphin variables created

## Next Steps: Revised Plan

Instead of "adding dolphins back", we need to:

1. **Verify dolphins are in processed data**: Check if dolphin columns exist in current processed files
2. **Implement dolphin intensity conversion**: Convert counts to 0-3 scale  
3. **Create marine community metrics**: Fish + dolphin combined variables
4. **Add comparative analysis**: Fish-only vs marine community modeling

## Files to Check Next
- `data/processed/01_detections_*_2021.parquet` - verify dolphin columns present
- Notebooks 03-06 - see how dolphin columns are handled in later analysis

## Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅
- [x] **Audit existing notebooks** - dolphins are actually included!
- [x] **Document current state** - this file
- [x] **Identify real issues** - metric compatibility, not exclusion

**Ready for Phase 2**: Focus on dolphin intensity conversion and marine community metrics.
