# Acoustic Indices Integration Plan
*Marine Biodiversity Dashboard - MBON USC 2025*

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the integration of comprehensive acoustic indices data (56 indices) with existing species detection and environmental data to answer the core research question: **"Can computed acoustic indices help us understand and predict marine biodiversity patterns as an alternative to expensive, labor-intensive manual species detection methods?"**

## Data Integration Strategy

### Current Status
- âœ… **Received**: `AcousticIndices_9M_FullBW_v1.csv` (2021, hourly data, 56 indices)
- ðŸ”„ **Expected**: Additional files for stations 14M, 37M, years 2018, and alternative bandwidths

### Flexible File Architecture
```
data/indices/raw/
â”œâ”€â”€ AcousticIndices_9M_FullBW_v1.csv      âœ… Available
â”œâ”€â”€ AcousticIndices_14M_FullBW_v1.csv     ðŸ”„ Expected
â”œâ”€â”€ AcousticIndices_37M_FullBW_v1.csv     ðŸ”„ Expected
â”œâ”€â”€ AcousticIndices_9M_2018_FullBW_v1.csv ðŸ”„ Expected (if naming changes)
â””â”€â”€ AcousticIndices_*_[OTHER_BW]_*.csv    ðŸ”„ Expected (additional bandwidth)
```

**Design Principles**:
- **Flexible naming**: Support variations in file naming conventions
- **Scalable**: Handle new stations, years, and bandwidth types automatically
- **Version tracking**: Support versioned files (v1, v2, etc.)
- **Quality flags**: Track data completeness and processing issues

## Processing Pipeline Architecture

### Modular Pipeline Design

```

### Key Processing Challenges & Solutions

#### 1. Temporal Alignment
**Challenge**: Acoustic indices are hourly, detection data is 2-hourly
**Solution**: Configurable aggregation methods
```python
AGGREGATION_METHODS = {
    'mean': np.mean,      # Default for most indices
    'max': np.max,        # For peak detection indices  
    'min': np.min,        # For minimum thresholds
    'sum': np.sum,        # For count-based indices
    'median': np.median   # For robust central tendency
}
```

#### 2. Missing Data Strategy
**Hierarchical approach**:
- **â‰¤2 hours**: Linear interpolation with quality flags
- **2-6 hours**: Mark as "interpolated", include with warnings
- **>6 hours**: Exclude from analysis, note in reports
- **Seasonal gaps**: Analyze available periods separately

#### 3. Index Selection & Filtering
**Multi-stage filtering**:
```python
# Stage 1: Technical filtering
- Remove indices with >20% missing data
- Remove zero-variance indices
- Remove perfectly correlated pairs (r > 0.95)

# Stage 2: Ecological relevance  
- Group by categories (temporal, frequency, diversity, etc.)
- Literature-based prioritization
- Expert knowledge integration

# Stage 3: PCA-informed selection
- Initial PCA on filtered set (~20-25 indices)
- Select high-loading indices for top 3-4 components
- Final analytical set: ~12-15 indices
```

## Analysis Framework

### Primary Analysis: Principal Component Analysis

#### Objectives
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce 56 indices to 3-5 interpretable components
2. **Index Ranking**: Identify most informative indices for biodiversity assessment
3. **Pattern Discovery**: Understand natural groupings and relationships

#### PCA Implementation Strategy
```python
# PCA Analysis Pipeline
1. Data preprocessing (standardization, missing data)
2. Initial PCA (all indices)
3. Component interpretation (loadings analysis)
4. Scree plot analysis (explained variance)
5. Index contribution rankings
6. Component score calculation
7. Biological interpretation
```

#### Expected Outputs

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage Architecture

mbon-dash-2025/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                    # Raw data (version controlled)
â”œâ”€â”€ processed/              # Intermediate files (gitignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis/               # Analysis results (gitignored)

â””â”€â”€ public/                 # Static assets only
```

### Flexible File Detection
```python
# Automatic file discovery
ACOUSTIC_INDEX_PATTERNS = [
    "AcousticIndices_{station}_{bandwidth}_v*.csv",
    "Acoustic_Indices_{station}_{bandwidth}_v*.csv",
    "{station}_AcousticIndices_{bandwidth}_v*.csv"
]

def discover_acoustic_files(data_dir):
    """Automatically find and categorize acoustic index files"""
    # Implementation handles naming variations
    # Returns structured metadata about available files
    # Logs missing expected files for user awareness
```

### Quality Control & Validation
```python
# Automated validation checks
- File format validation (expected columns)
- Data range checks (reasonable index values)
- Temporal continuity assessment
- Cross-file consistency verification
- Missing data pattern analysis
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Availability Risks
**Risk**: New acoustic index files may have different formats/naming
**Mitigation**: Flexible parsing with extensive error handling and logging

**Risk**: Missing expected files (other stations/years)
**Mitigation**: Pipeline works with available data, clearly documents gaps

### Analysis Risks  
**Risk**: PCA may not reveal interpretable patterns
**Mitigation**: Multiple analysis approaches (hierarchical clustering, factor analysis)

**Risk**: Indices may not predict biodiversity well
**Mitigation**: Focus on understanding relationships rather than just prediction

### Timeline Risks
**Risk**: Analysis takes longer than expected
**Mitigation**: Iterative presentation approach, each milestone stands alone

## Success Criteria
