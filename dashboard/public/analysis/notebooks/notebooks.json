(Note that we do plan to also process 2018 data but are starting here.) We're combining multiple data streams to understand marine biodiversity patterns:\n\n    - **Acoustic indices**: Computed soundscape metrics that capture ecosystem acoustic activity \n    - **Manual fish detections**: Human-annotated intensity level of fish species every 2 hours (where intensity level is a 0-3 integer scale with 0 being no calls, 1 being one, 2 being multiple, and 3 being a chorus where calls cannot be distinguished from each other.)\n    - **Environmental data**: Temperature (20-min intervals) and depth (1-hour intervals) measurements. Depth data can be used as a proxy for tide.\n    - **SPL data**: Sound pressure levels across frequency bands (broadband, low 50-1200Hz, high 7000-40000Hz)\n    - **Vessel detections**: Ship noise events (included in manual detection files)\n\n    Each data type was collected at different temporal resolutions, requiring careful alignment for integrated analysis."
