(Note that we do plan to also process 2018 data but are starting here.) We're combining multiple data streams to understand marine biodiversity patterns:\n\n    - **Acoustic indices**: Computed soundscape metrics that capture ecosystem acoustic activity \n    - **Manual fish detections**: Human-annotated intensity level of fish species every 2 hours (where intensity level is a 0-3 integer scale with 0 being no calls, 1 being one, 2 being multiple, and 3 being a chorus where calls cannot be distinguished from each other.)\n    - **Environmental data**: Temperature (20-min intervals) and depth (1-hour intervals) measurements. Depth data can be used as a proxy for tide.\n    - **SPL data**: Sound pressure levels across frequency bands (broadband, low 50-1200Hz, high 7000-40000Hz)\n    - **Vessel detections**: Ship noise events (included in manual detection files)\n\n    Each data type was collected at different temporal resolutions, requiring careful alignment for integrated analysis."

The raw data comes at different temporal resolutions:\n\n    - **Manual fish detections**: Already at 2-hour intervals (our target resolution)\n    - **Acoustic indices**: Calculated hourly from continuous recordings  \n    - **Temperature data**: Logged every 20 minutes by autonomous sensors\n    - **Depth/pressure data**: Recorded hourly for tidal analysis\n    - **SPL (Sound Pressure Level)**: Calculated hourly from acoustic recordings\n\n    The 2-hour target resolution matches the manual detection protocol, where trained analysts reviewed 2-minute segments recorded every 2-hours and scored fish calling activity on a 0-3 intensity scale for each species. This temporal framework becomes our analytical backbone.\n\n    ## Process Overview\n\n    **Data Alignment Steps:**\n\n    1. **Load processed data** from Notebook 1 (all stations, all data types)\n    2. **Examine temporal patterns** to understand each data stream's characteristics  \n    3. **Create 2-hour time grids** using detection timestamps as the reference\n    4. **Aggregate higher-resolution data** (temperature, indices) to 2-hour means\n    5. **Align lower-resolution data** (depth, SPL) to 2-hour windows\n    6. **Engineer temporal features** for biological pattern recognition\n    7. **Create lag variables** to capture delayed ecological responses\n    8. **Generate organized outputs** by data type for downstream analysis\n\n    **Why This Matters:**\n    - Enables integration of acoustic, environmental, and biological data\n    - Preserves temporal patterns critical for understanding marine soundscape ecology  \n    - Creates features that capture both immediate and delayed responses to environmental changes\n    - Establishes consistent temporal framework for species-specific calling pattern analysis"
