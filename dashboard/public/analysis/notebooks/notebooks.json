(Note that we do plan to also process 2018 data but are starting here.) We're combining multiple data streams to understand marine biodiversity patterns:\n\n    - **Acoustic indices**: Computed soundscape metrics that capture ecosystem acoustic activity \n    - **Manual fish detections**: Human-annotated intensity level of fish species every 2 hours (where intensity level is a 0-3 integer scale with 0 being no calls, 1 being one, 2 being multiple, and 3 being a chorus where calls cannot be distinguished from each other.)\n    - **Environmental data**: Temperature (20-min intervals) and depth (1-hour intervals) measurements. Depth data can be used as a proxy for tide.\n    - **SPL data**: Sound pressure levels across frequency bands (broadband, low 50-1200Hz, high 7000-40000Hz)\n    - **Vessel detections**: Ship noise events (included in manual detection files)\n\n    Each data type was collected at different temporal resolutions, requiring careful alignment for integrated analysis."

    "fullMarkdown": "# Notebook 2: Temporal Alignment and Aggregation\n\n    **Purpose**: Align all data to consistent 2-hour temporal resolution matching manual detections  \n    **Key Outputs**: Four separate, analysis-ready datasets organized by data type\n\n    ## Overview\n\n    This notebook addresses the critical challenge of temporal misalignment across our diverse data streams. The raw data comes at different temporal resolutions:\n\n    - **Manual fish detections**: Already at 2-hour intervals (our target resolution)\n    - **Acoustic indices**: Calculated hourly from continuous recordings  \n    - **Temperature data**: Logged every 20 minutes by autonomous sensors\n    - **Depth/pressure data**: Recorded hourly for tidal analysis\n    - **SPL (Sound Pressure Level)**: Calculated hourly from acoustic recordings\n\n    The 2-hour target resolution matches the manual detection protocol, where trained analysts reviewed 2-minute segments recorded every 2-hours and scored fish calling activity on a 0-3 intensity scale for each species. This temporal framework becomes our analytical backbone.\n\n    ## Process Overview\n\n    **Data Alignment Steps:**\n\n    1. **Load processed data** from Notebook 1 (all stations, all data types)\n    2. **Examine temporal patterns** to understand each data stream's characteristics  \n    3. **Create 2-hour time grids** using detection timestamps as the reference\n    4. **Aggregate higher-resolution data** (temperature, indices) to 2-hour means\n    5. **Align lower-resolution data** (depth, SPL) to 2-hour windows\n    6. **Engineer temporal features** for biological pattern recognition\n    7. **Create lag variables** to capture delayed ecological responses\n    8. **Generate organized outputs** by data type for downstream analysis\n\n    **Why This Matters:**\n    - Enables integration of acoustic, environmental, and biological data\n    - Preserves temporal patterns critical for understanding marine soundscape ecology  \n    - Creates features that capture both immediate and delayed responses to environmental changes\n    - Establishes consistent temporal framework for species-specific calling pattern analysis"

    "fullMarkdown": "## Index-Manual Detection Concordance Analysis\n\n    Now we analyze whether acoustic indices capture the same temporal patterns as manual detections. This is the **critical validation** for using indices as proxies.\n\n    **Key Questions:**\n\n    1. Do acoustic indices show the same **diel patterns** as fish calling?\n    2. Do indices identify the same **seasonal peaks** (spawning periods)?\n    3. Can indices distinguish between **high/low activity periods**?\n    4. What would we conclude about fish activity using **indices alone**?\n\n    **Approach:**\n\n    - Calculate temporal patterns for selected acoustic indices\n    - Compare index patterns with manual detection patterns\n    - Assess pattern concordance using correlation and visual inspection"
