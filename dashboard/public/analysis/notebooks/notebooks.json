We load and examine all primary data streams including acoustic indices, manual fish detections, environmental measurements, and vessel presence data to understand data quality, temporal coverage, and basic patterns before proceeding to temporal alignment and analysis.\n\n    ## 1. Load Acoustic Indices Data\n\n    Acoustic indices are mathematical summaries of soundscape recordings that capture different aspects of ecosystem acoustic activity. The FullBW (full bandwidth) version includes indices computed across the entire frequency range of the hydrophones. These metrics help quantify biodiversity, ecosystem health, and acoustic complexity without requiring species-specific identification."

By aggregating everything to a common 2-hour resolution and engineering relevant features, we create analysis-ready datasets that preserve ecological information while enabling modeling.\n\n    ## 1. Load Processed Data from Notebook 1\n\n    Loading the cleaned and standardized data streams from each station. Notebook 1 performed quality control,\n    standardized column names, and converted timestamps to consistent formats. Here we systematically load:\n\n    - **Acoustic indices** (50-60 indices per station): Hourly summaries of soundscape characteristics\n    - **Detection data** (2-hour intervals): Manual annotations of fish calling activity by species  \n    - **Temperature data** (20-min intervals): Water temperature from autonomous sensors\n    - **Depth data** (hourly): Water depth measurements for tidal pattern analysis\n    - **SPL data** (hourly): Sound pressure levels in multiple frequency bands\n\n    **Expected Outcome**: Five data dictionaries organized by data type and station, ready for temporal alignment."

This is the **critical validation** for using indices as proxies.\n\n    **Key Questions:**\n\n    1. Do acoustic indices show the same **diel patterns** as fish calling?\n    2. Do indices identify the same **seasonal peaks** (spawning periods)?\n    3. Can indices distinguish between **high/low activity periods**?\n    4. What would we conclude about fish activity using **indices alone**?\n\n    **Approach:**\n\n    - Calculate temporal patterns for selected acoustic indices\n    - Compare index patterns with manual detection patterns\n    - Assess pattern concordance using correlation and visual inspection"
